How many java packages?
user defined
   -In java, we already have various pre-defined packages and these packages contain large numbers of classes and interfaces that we
 used in java are known as Built-in packages.
build-in packages
   -As the name suggests user-defined packages are a package 
that is defined by the user or programmer.
ex:lang, io, util, SQL, etc

jawa.awt?
  -This package is the main package of the abstract window kit. 
  -it includes the classes for graphics, 
containing the java 2D graphics and 
it also defines the graphical user interface(GUI) framework for java.
 this package had several heavy GUI objects which come under java. swing package

Import explanation?
 -import is a Java keyword. It declares a Java class to use in the code below the import statement.
 Once a Java class is declared, then the class name can be used in the code 
without specifying the package the class belongs to. 
-Use the '*' character to declare all the classes belonging to the package.

package defenition?

 -A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
  -A package is simply a container that groups related types (Java classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations).


 What is array list?
  -ava ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
 It is like an array, but there is no size limit.
 We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array.

Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis.

Linked List?
 -Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

Diff between linked list nd array list?

1
Internal Implementation
ArrayList =internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements.
LinkedList =uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
2
Manipulation
ArrayList= is slow as array manipulation is slower.
LinkedList= is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
3
Implementation
ArrayList =implements only List.
LinkedList =implements List as well as Queue. It can acts as a queue as well.
4
Access
ArrayList =is faster in storing and accessing data.
LinkedList =is faster in manipulation of data.


what is object casting?
 -Objects of a class can be cast into objects of another class 
if both classes are related to each other through the property of inheritance
 -one class is the parent class, and the other class is the child class. 
This type of casting superclass object (parent class) will hold the sub-class object's properties.
 
What is string?
string is a sequence of characters
